# Citing stuff

There has been a proliferation of research involving human participants on the topic of violence. Since 2008, the percent of articles in six top political science journals that study violence and involve human participants has doubled, from about 3\% to more than 6\%.\footnote{Journals in the review include the American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, World Politics, Journal of Peace Research, and Journal of Conflict Resolution.} The boom of field research on violence has been fueled by a number of goals: the desire to test the ``microfoundations'' of theories about the causes and consequences of conflict [@kertzer2017microfoundations], the demand for research designs that identify causal claims [@gerber2004illusion], and concerns that the perspectives of people affected by conflict should be represented [@pearlman2017crossed]. Most importantly, the proliferation of research in violent contexts is driven by a desire to use high quality evidence to inform policies to mitigate and prevent violence.
